# Workflows

Each directory within [workflows](/workflows/) directory represents a particular use case and contains sample files and directory structure for submitting jobs with HTCondor in CHTC.

> Note: Always test new workflows for a small (2-5) number of jobs before attempting to use the new workflow at full scale.

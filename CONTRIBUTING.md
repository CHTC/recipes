## Organization

The [software](/software/) directory is organized by the top level 
software program, that is, the main program that 
the container is intended for.
For example, the container for SUMO also has Python installed, but Python 
is a required dependency of SUMO.
Therefore SUMO is the top level program, and so the container for SUMO is 
hosted in [software/SUMO](/software/SUMO/) 
and not in [software/Python](/softare/Python/).

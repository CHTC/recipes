Program overview: https://www.vasp.at/info/about/

> The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) is a computer program for atomic scale materials modelling, 
> e.g. electronic structure calculations and quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics, from first principles.
> VASP computes an approximate solution to the many-body SchrÃ¶dinger equation, either within density functional theory (DFT), 
> solving the Kohn-Sham equations, or within the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation, solving the Roothaan equations.

# FEBio Studio

Container definition files for FEBio Studio.

Program overview: [https://febio.org/](https://febio.org/)

> FEBio is a software tool for nonlinear finite element analysis in biomechanics and biophysics and is specifically focused on solving nonlinear large deformation problems in biomechanics and biophysics. 
> Aside from structural mechanics, it can also solve problems in mixture mechanics (i.e. biphasic or multiphasic materials), fluid mechanics, reaction-diffusion, and heat transfer. 
> As a true multiphysics code, it can also solve coupled physics problems, including fluid-solid interactions.

## Obtaining the installer file

Installer executable is available from [https://febio.org/downloads/](https://febio.org/downloads/).
Be sure to download the Linux version of the installer, "FEBioStudio-#.#.#-linux-x64-installer.run". 
This file needs to be transferred to the same directory as the container definition file you are using to build the container.
